    Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.
    This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.
    You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8. The number
    will correspond to the board position as illustrated:
    0 | 1 | 2
    ---------
    3 | 4 | 5
    ---------
    6 | 7 | 8
    Prepare yourself, human. The ultimate battle is about to begin. \n
